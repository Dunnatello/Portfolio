# Dunnatello's Portfolio
## Description

I created this website project to improve my web development skills and display my projects in a unique way.  

Feel free to check out how I implemented my portfolio website!

## Lessons Learned
This project is a direct result of lessons learned from my ASP.NET Core website implementation found [here](https://github.com/Dunnatello/DotNetPortfolioWebsite).  

After overcoming the challenges faced in that project, I converted the ASP.NET Core project to a simple HTML/CSS implementation seen in this repository.

## Technical Details
This website uses only HTML/CSS and is currently hosted on Microsoft Azure Cloud platform as a Static Web App.
The base CSS styling comes from the Bootstrap library with some additional CSS used for displaying my portfolio content.
