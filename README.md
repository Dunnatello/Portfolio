# Dunnatello's Portfolio
## Description
This is the repository for my portfolio website located [here](https://dunnatello.com/).  

I created this website project to improve my web development skills and display my projects in a unique way.  

Feel free to check out how I implemented my portfolio website!


## Original Design

<p align="center"><b>Figure 1:</b> The home page features multiple containers that allow the user to visit the 'Projects' or 'About' pages.</p>

## Design Refresh

My portfolio website has undergone a complete redesign to feature a more modern and sleek appearance.

<p align="center"><b>Figure 2:</b> The new design features a "hero" section that covers the entire display. A moving chevron arrow signals to the user that they can scroll down to see more content.</p>

## Lessons Learned
This project is a direct result of lessons learned from my ASP.NET Core website implementation found [here](https://github.com/Dunnatello/DotNetPortfolioWebsite).  

After overcoming the challenges faced in that project, I converted the ASP.NET Core project to a simple HTML/CSS implementation seen in this repository.

## Technical Details
This website uses only HTML/CSS and is currently hosted on Microsoft Azure Cloud platform as a Static Web App.


Originally, the base CSS styling came from the Bootstrap library with some additional CSS used for displaying my portfolio content. However, the website has been redesigned to use custom styling instead.
