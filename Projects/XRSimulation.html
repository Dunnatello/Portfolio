            <h2 class="section-title">Description</h2>
            <p>My team was tasked with developing an interactive virtual reality simulation. 
                This simulation is designed to expose student teachers to a classroom environment and allow them to practice de-escalation scenarios 
                that may arise during their careers.</p>

            <p>The application features scenario designs that incorporate elements that cannot be demonstrated with actors due to potential risks. 
                It also allows for more effective training with repeatable scenarios. The users can interact with the students and objects in different ways and will 
                get feedback from the simulation on their performance and how they can improve.</p>
            
            <h2 class="section-title">Summary</h2>
            <p>In this project, I learned numerous different skills that can be used in future game and simulation development projects. 
                After completing this project, I have gained a greater understanding of simulation software development and team coordination and collaboration.
                My team faced numerous challenges, but we solved these challenges and produced a great minimum-viable product that can be expanded in the future.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Key Features</h2>
            
            <h3 class="section-subtitle">User Interfaces</h3>
            <p>Before starting this project, I had already worked on numerous user interfaces (UI) for my projects, 
                so I had experience with designing UI previously.</p> 
                
            <p>However, designing user interfaces for VR experiences is slightly different since it requires UI to be physically placed in the world and not attached to 
                the user's camera.</p>
                
            <p>We were debating on diegetic (integrated into the story) or non-diegetic interfaces for the user to use to adjust their preferences and interact 
                with the scenarios.
                Ultimately, we went with non-diegetic interfaces for our project due to time constraints and ease of use.</p>

            <h3 class="section-subtitle">Blend Shape Animations</h3>

            <p>Blend shapes are used in animation to morph shapes to transition between different sets of geometry.</p>

            <p>We utilized blend shapes to create more immersive characters, enabling realistic facial expressions, eye movements, and lip synchronization.</p>
            
            <p>In this project, I used the blend shapes created in the modular character pack to make the characters more immersive. 
                I used the blend shapes to trigger blinking, animate eye movement, show emotions, as well as display realistic realtime lip sync.</p>
            
            <p>Learning about blend shapes will allow me to work on future projects that feature immersive characters and cinematics. </p>

            <h3 class="section-subtitle">Lip Syncing</h3>
            <p>After discovering the open-source uLipSync project, I integrated realtime lip syncing into the project. 
                By implementing this framework, I was able to understand how the system worked and I can use the same techniques in future projects that 
                require character dialogue.</p>
            
            <p>uLipSync can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/hecomi/uLipSync">hecomi/uLipSync</a>.</p>

            <h3 class="section-subtitle">Narrative-Driven Gameplay</h3>
            <p>Throughout the project, I had to design systems (and provided pseudocode to my team members) that would adapt to fit our narrative design.</p>
            
            <p>My team had to complete complex tasks to create the right solution to fit our scenario narratives, so I can now understand how complex 
                narrative experiences integrate with cinematics to form a complete product.</p>
            
            <p>Additionally, working with Yarn Spinner has allowed me to develop branching narratives and I can use those skills in future narrative-driven projects.</p>

            <h3 class="section-subtitle">Optimization for Quest 2 Headsets</h3>
            <p>While working on this project, we ran into different challenges when developing standalone VR experiences. 
                Since resources are limited on standalone VR headsets compared to traditional PC VR capabilities, we had to adapt and 
                continuously test different strategies to improve performance over time.</p>
            
            <p>For example, I was originally planning on incorporating a realistic glass shader for the UI menus present in the lobby along with the 
                classroom scenes. However, while testing, we noticed that performance dropped significantly when looking at the UI, so we ultimately decided to 
                revert to a simple transparent “URP/Lit” shader.</p>

                <p class="media-caption">We utilized Unity's occlusion culling system along with a custom frustum culling solution that I designed 
                    for NPCs to optimize performance</p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="section-subtitle">Animation Systems</h3>
            <p>This project has taught us how to implement complex animation systems to achieve our goals. By designing animation systems to support our 
                narrative design, we were able to learn how to use Unity’s animation system to its full potential by using animation events, 
                creating a few of our animations, and using free animations from Adobe Mixamo for our characters.</p>

            <p>Additionally, implementing and troubleshooting a system that swaps between animation controllers to allow characters to flip desks
                 within the scene allowed us to understand how professional game developers accomplish the same tasks in their work.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Final Thoughts</h2>

            <h3 class="section-subtitle">What We Would Have Done Differently</h3>
            <p>Numerous features could have been implemented differently if we had the knowledge that we gained from this project.</p>

            <p>After integrating Yarn Spinner in the final weeks of the project, I discovered that Yarn Spinner has useful features such as Yarn commands, 
                which allow developers to implement custom methods that are called from Yarn scripts.</p>

            <p>Therefore, if I had learned about this functionality at the beginning of the project, I might have scaled down the goal progression system 
                to a simpler implementation. However, the goal progression system does have its benefits in that it does not rely on Yarn Spinner at all for functionality,
                 so any dialogue system could be implemented to replace this third-party system at any time.</p>
            
            <p>Additionally, we learned that it is important to design the scenario narratives early to ensure that all requirements 
                are met for the scenario's implementation. The implementation of core features took an extended period, so we were not able to test everything 
                running together until the last few weeks of the project. Therefore, developers must plan their task schedules wisely to avoid slowdowns 
                throughout development.</p>
            
            <h3 class="section-subtitle">Conclusion</h3>
            <p>After completing this project, I am now confident in my ability to work on complicated game development projects in the future.</p>
            <p>I gained numerous important skills from this project such as cinematic design, advanced animation systems, lip syncing, branching narrative development, 
                and optimization. I am thankful for this valuable experience that this project has taught me and I am excited to use my newly acquired 
                skills in future projects.</p>
